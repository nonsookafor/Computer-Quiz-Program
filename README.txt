To run the program, run "python3 final.py"
Once the program is run, you are told to input your name. This is the frst thing to do. Then, you are told to type "start" to begin. Typing any other thing will print "sorry, type start" and you would be told to input again. After typing start, You would be given a small instructuin advising you on what to get ready before starting the examination and then you would be told to type continue to continue. Typing any other thing would print "sorry, type continue" until continue is typed.
You would then be randomly asked questions where you are to type the only the letters 'A, B, C or D' as your answers which represent the options. You would also be required to type "enter" to continue. Typing any other thing will print "sorry, type enter" and you would be required to type enter again. This repeats itself until all questions are answered.
You would then be told your score, your score summary which summaries the questions you got wrong and right and whether or not you made a high score. You would also be told those with high scores from ascending to descending order and yours would be among if you made a high score.
After this, you would be asked if you want to retake the failed questions. You should type only yes or no. Typing any other thing will print "sorry, type yes or no" and you would be required to type yes or no. You are to also type no if you got all questions right. Typing no would tell you that you have finished writing the exam. If you type yes, you would be asked to type start and continue with the same conditions as before. You are also to answer the questions you failed in the same conditions as before.
After that, you would be told that you have retaken the exam and your response summary for the questions you failed before would also be printed.
Everything ends there.


To run the tests, run "python3 test_final.py"
I tested five out of six helper functions and the all worked. To show that all tests passed and that the program ran, I printed "Hurray, code worked" before asserting. I left a lot of spaces before and after it so that it could be seen clearly. Not seeing an assertionn error means that the code passed all test cases.
For the functions test_choose_question() and test_choose_retake_question(), you have to answer the questions first before knowing if an assertion errot is given. However, you would see what is to be printed to show your code ran. After answering each question and no assertion error is seen, it means it passed all test cases.
